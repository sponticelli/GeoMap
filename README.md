# GeoMap: Interactive Geographic Data Visualization

A Unity project demonstrating human-AI collaboration in software development, focused on creating an interactive geographic data visualization system using GeoJSON data.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a comprehensive case study in **human-AI collaborative software development**, showcasing how humans and AI can work together effectively to build complex, interactive applications. The GeoMap system transforms GeoJSON geographic data into an interactive 3D Unity application with country selection, highlighting, and camera controls.

## Purpose Statement

**This was a human-AI collaboration experiment** designed to explore and demonstrate effective patterns for human-AI partnership in software development. The project focused on:

- Testing iterative development workflows between human developers and AI assistants
- Exploring AI capabilities in complex Unity development tasks
- Establishing best practices for steering AI tools through multi-component software projects
- Demonstrating how AI can assist with both architectural decisions and implementation details

## What the Project Accomplishes

## Lessons Learned from Human-AI Collaboration

Through this development process, several key insights emerged about effective human-AI collaboration:

### âœ… What Works Well

- **Human-AI collaboration involves steering AI tools through iterative tasks**: The human developer provides high-level direction while the AI handles implementation details
- **AI can help with data processing and suggesting alternatives**: AI excels at parsing complex data structures, generating boilerplate code, and proposing architectural solutions
- **Detailed task descriptions and code context guide AI effectively**: Providing specific requirements, existing code examples, and clear constraints leads to better AI output

### ðŸŽ¯ Critical Success Factors

- **Humans should control high-level problem solving and architecture**: Strategic decisions, overall system design, and user experience considerations remain human responsibilities
- **Provide detailed task descriptions and code to guide AI**: The more context and specificity provided, the more accurate and useful AI assistance becomes
- **Know when to interrupt and reset AI tasks to stay on track**: Recognizing when AI is going down unproductive paths and redirecting early prevents wasted effort

### ðŸ”„ Iterative Development Patterns

- **Break complex features into smaller, manageable tasks**: AI performs better with focused, well-defined objectives
- **Use AI for rapid prototyping and refinement**: AI can quickly generate multiple implementation approaches for evaluation
- **Maintain human oversight of integration and testing**: While AI can write individual components, humans excel at ensuring system cohesion

## Technical Architecture

The project follows clean code principles with a modular, event-driven architecture:

```
