🔷 1. Root Structure: FeatureCollection

The root of the document is a GeoJSON FeatureCollection, defined as:

{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [ ... ]
}

✅ Fields:
	•	type: Always "FeatureCollection" for this file.
	•	features: An array of Feature objects, each representing a country.

⸻

🔍 2. features[] Array

Each object in the features array represents a single country, structured as follows:

{
  "type": "Feature",
  "properties": {
    "ADMIN": "Country Name",
    "ISO_A3": "3-letter-code"
  },
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon" or "MultiPolygon",
    "coordinates": [...]
  }
}


⸻

📄 3. properties Object

The properties object stores metadata about the country.

🏷️ Key Fields:
	•	ADMIN: The official country name (e.g., "Italy").
	•	ISO_A3: The 3-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code (e.g., "ITA").

These are the main identifiers for linking geographical data to other datasets.

⸻

🌍 4. geometry Object

Defines the shape of the country in terms of latitude and longitude.

🎯 geometry.type:
	•	"Polygon": Used when the country has a single contiguous landmass.
	•	"MultiPolygon": Used for countries with disjointed territories (e.g., archipelagos, overseas territories).

🧭 geometry.coordinates:

This is a nested array of positions, which depends on the geometry type:

If type is "Polygon":

"coordinates": [
  [ [lon, lat], [lon, lat], ..., [lon, lat] ] // Outer boundary
  // Optionally: inner boundaries (holes), if any
]

If type is "MultiPolygon":

"coordinates": [
  [ // First polygon
    [ [lon, lat], [lon, lat], ..., [lon, lat] ]
  ],
  [ // Second polygon
    [ [lon, lat], [lon, lat], ..., [lon, lat] ]
  ]
  // and so on
]

⚠️ 5. Edge Cases and Special Considerations

Case	Description
MultiPolygon	Common for island nations like Indonesia or Philippines.
Unusual Shapes	Countries with borders that include exclaves or complex holes (e.g., Armenia, Azerbaijan).
Long Coordinate Chains	Coordinates can run into thousands of points—optimize for performance.
Antarctica or territories	Large, sparse, or simplified polygons may cause projection issues.
Missing or null values	Always validate presence of ADMIN, ISO_A3, and geometry. Some entries may lack geometry if malformed.
